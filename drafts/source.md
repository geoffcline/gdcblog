I agree it would be more convineient if we could publish directly to personal github pages. 

The chance of amazon permitting developers to freely[1] post work product[2] to their personal github accounts is zero. 

This fact is set it in stone. Amazon work product must be stored in amazon controlled accounts. It is explicit in amazon's formal policy [3], employement contracts [4], and internal rules [5]. 

We must seek to understand the constraints the legal and open source teams are forced to live under.[6] If we are to be successful, we must be allies with them to improve the process. Blanket assertions that the process is unworkable and outdated will fall on extremely deaf ears. We can awkaen them with by communicating we understand their ocnstraints, and ideas for solutions. 

We should make a genuine effort to use the aws-samples github org.
