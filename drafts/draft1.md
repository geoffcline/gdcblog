# Acne Skincare for Adults

It's a common misconception that acne "is just a phase" -- that it resolves natually with age. Acne often hangs around into adulthood and beyond. Additionally, some dermatologists considered clear skin as a mission accomplished -- no more treatment needed. 

A simple skincare routine is essential for people with acne. Even if treatment was a success (as it was for me), it's important to have a maintenance routine. 

That doesn't mean bringing back outdated and unnecessary antiboitics. Let's take a look at some clinically effective and specific (i.e., not systemic) ingredients, that you can find in cheap-ish products at target. 

## Benzoyl Peroxide

This is chemical that you apply topically to your face. It kills bacteria, inclding those that want to form acne. The cool thing is that it doesn't contribute to the antibiotic resitance problem. 

I use it in a fase cleanser/wash from CeraVe. It's a great product to apply after you have gotten sweaty and been exposed to the outdoors/pollution/public. It goes a step beyond normal cleansers to really reduce bacteria. 

But it doesn't stop thee. Not even close. It is also "sebostatic" and "comedolytic" (wikipedia)

This can bleach (e.e., make white stains on) fabrics, such as pillows or shirts. I avoid this by using the face wash in the shower. 

I previously used a cream, but I encountered the staining problem. Also, it was an additional step. 

I, personally, find this ingredient helpful in reducing the number of pimples that I get. However, it seems to work better on smaller ones and outside of the major "problem areas" I have.
