I've been tested numerous times for COVID-19. It was super easy, in my experience. However, few people seem to know about these testing options. 

You can [order a test online through Pixel](https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/covid-19), LabCorp's premium self-directed testin`g brand. You collect a nose sample at home and ship it back. The results are delivered by email. The test only detects active infections and is not an antibody test. 

**Overall, it's great!**

LabCorp is one of the two major diagnostic testing companies and is very reputable. I personally confirm that my Amazon provided insurance through Premera covered 100% of the test cost. 

If you prefer an in-person test, I've collected some handy [tools to find nearby locations.](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Users/gcline/covid-test/#HLocationFinderLinks)

# General Process

1. Complete a COVID-19 specific screening quiz. 
1. Setup an online profile, including your insurance information. 
1. Receive the sample collection kit via overnight delivery. 
1. Swab gently inside your nose.
1. Call UPS to schedule a doorstep pickup of the testing kit or place it in a UPS drop box. 
1. Receive your test results by email in 24-48 hours. LabCorp operates 24/7. 

## Screening Quiz

You need to take a screening quiz before ordering the test.

Keep an eye out for the two most useful options. I've provided some example situations, to indicate how you might qualify for testing. 

**Congregate Setting**
* Planning to visit someone at elevated risk, such as an elderly family member
* Work in an office
* Live with people who may be exposed, such as essential workers or healthcare providers
* Travel by airplane, bus, or train

**Testing Recommended**
* Planning travel that requires or suggests testing
* Medical professional recommends testing
* Testing recommended by your interpretation of local guidelines

If you aren't selected for testing after completing the quiz, simply close the browser and retry. Many people don't fully consider the options presented.

# Additional Test Considerations

## Test Types

**Active Infection**

*  Nose Swap
*  Can be done at home, or collected by a professional
*  Only detects if you are currently infected with COVID-19
*  If you they can't detect COVID-19 in your nose sample, then you can't spread it
*  However, you may later develop a COVID-19 infection.

**Antibody Blood Test**

*  Blood sample
*  Must be collected by a professional in an office
*  Detects if you have COVID-19 antibodies, which may indicate immunity. 
*  Learn if you had COVID-19 in the past six months

## Test Delivery

I prefer ordering the test online and collecting the sample myself.

However, you can also visit a testing location to have a professional do it. It may detect an infection in the earliest stages. 

**Order Online, Self-Collect Sample, Return by Mail**
* Convenient
* Only swap inside the tip of your nose, not very deep
* Easy
* Detects active infections, if you are spreading the disease

**In Person, Deep Nasal Swap done by Professional**
*    Official Testing Site, Doctors Office, Urgent Care
*    Cotton swap inserted into each nostril for 15 seconds, roughly 4-5 inches deep
*    About as uncomfortable as a tetanus shot, but takes longer
*    May detect an infection a few hours to a day earlier, but further research is needed

Personally, I think the self-collected test is the better option. 

## In Person Testing Locations

If you do prefer an in-person test, they are available through different types of locations. 

**Official Government Testing Centers**
*  May have a long wait time
*  Few locations
*  Unclear who is eligible for testing
*  Difficult to locate your testing center
*  Unlikely you can reserve an appointment online
*  Free

**Convenient Care Locations (Pharmacy)**
*  CVS, Walgreens, Walmart
*  Schedule online
*  Find locations offering COVID-19 tests online
*  Low Cost

**Primary Care Provider's Office or Urgent Care**
*  Call ahead to confirm they offer COVID-19 testing
*  If you have an established account, you may be able to schedule online
