It's September 8th, and the current temperature in my bedroom is 87 degrees (f). It's Hot as Hell in Seattle. 

## Windows

My apartment is designed for efficent and modern living, as enforced by Seattle's regulatory system. 

Seattle's regulatory system fails to consider Summer. This is brushed off because it's `only a few weeks`. Fuck that. That's how seasons work. Also, it's no longer a few weeks. It's a third of the year. 

The season of Winter is given disproprorptionate consideration, given that freezing temperatures are factually limited to only a few weeks. 

New units must meet strict environmental and energy standards, implemented through comprehensive heat insulation. The windows in my apartment are top quality. They have multiple layers, providing enhanced heat and noise isolation. The goal is to retain heat in the winter. Reasonable. 

The effect is to create an unberable kiln of exhaustion as the summer stretches into september. 

A physics included person may note that, theoretically, the insulating properties of my home should be just as effective in reverse. The difficulty in heat escaping the home should equate to a difficulty in heat penetrating.

However, a more acute observer will notice that windows permit light to pass through. This light, combined with the insulating effect, actually permits the interior temperature to raise signifigantly above the external air temperature. Or, more generally, the interior becomes hell. 

## Climate Change

I have not negleted the other components of hell. Heat alone is insuficent. Smoke must be present also. 

The wildfires in eastern washington have risen to the challenge, smoke abounds. Seattle is the hottest new barbeque destination. 

The tormet of deciding between opening windows to the choking fumes, and closing them to face escelating interior heat, adds the *je ne sais quoi*, completeing the hell experience. 

## Be Fan Smart

Last year, I received a pamphlet from Seattle City Light, urging me to *Be Fan Smart* -- avoiding excessive use of interior fans. 

Seattle receives over 80% of it's energy from hydroelectric (very renewable) sources. The firey rage I generated personally, combined with the energy stored in the printed paper, is an untapped energy source itself. 

## One Trick to Beat the Heat

I prophesize (fantisize?) a cataclysmic event. Seattle's General Shittyness[1][2][3][4][5] tips the scale, and the market for high rent apartments begins to contract. 

In a desperate move to avoid decreasing rents, landlords try to add distinctive features. 

They are now forced to implement the air conditioning systems they avoided during construction. The costs are magnified at their moment of weakness. The ductwork must be awkwardly shoved into the unit. 

I will drink their tears, and it will be refreshing in this heat.
