## resistance architecture
= messages! 
    - secure storage locally
    - common to have app installed
    - secure in transit
    - but can access other devices
- signing not good for anon id verify
    - tied to people?
    - can't just match two public keys
    - message! "hey do you trust X?"
    - user has to accept message
    - "hey I trust x"
    - forward trust questions?
- special chat history
    - eg medical
    - import messages from different people
    - send the whole thing?
- user? special handles?
    - must still be friends to get new handle?
    - one way linked list?
    - user specific handles?

## slack vs email, respect the user
- clients
- notification
- rules
- one place to see messages from different groups
- advanced rules
- advanced folder view
- good: progress on threads
- how can I personally make UI mockups?
- good: rich user profiles
- good: github model of join/leave org
    - but single profile
- discord model!
    - the zoomers like it for a reason
    - one profile
    - pay at the user level
    - or member of premium org
