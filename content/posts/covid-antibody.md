It's possible to order your own COVID-19 antibody test. 

This test looks for antibodies in your blood, that indicate previous exposure to COVID-19. If you have COVID-19 antibodies, you may be immune to new infections, and unable to spread the disease. It's unknown how long antibodies last, but six months is reasonable.

The process of ordering the antibody test is slightly confusing. First, order the LabCorp test. Second, schedule your appointment. Interestingly, these two processes are done seperately. 

## LabCorp Patient Account
Create, or login, to your LabCorp Patient Account 

https://patient.labcorp.com/

The LabCorp Patient Account, used to order antibody tests, is *seperate* from any LabCorp Pixel account. If you've done a mail-in active infection COVID test, that information will be stored in a Pixel Account. The username and password for the Pixel website is different, and unrelated.

If you've ever done testing clinical (ordered by a doctor) testing with LabCorp before, you will have a LabCorp patient file. Most hosptials and physicans groups use a lab services provider, such as LabCorp. You probabbly already have lab results on file. When signing up for the LabCorp patient website, you may be asked identity verification questions, to access past test results. 

## Place Order with LabCorp

Order the COVID-19 Antibody test through Labcorp Patient.

Answer `no` to all of the screening quetions, unless otherwise indicated. 

Provide your health insurance information. If you have multiple health insurance plans, contact LabCorp. 

### Order Completed

After your antibody test is ordered, you can walk into any labcorp location and wait for the next available technican to collect your sample. 

However, I strongly suggest setting an appointment. 

## Find Location

There are multiple lapcorp locations in (almost) every city in the USA. Seattle has numerous locations.

However, these locations are often within hospitals, medical offices, and office towers. They can be hard to find. 

Use the LabCorp website to find a nearby location https://www.labcorp.com/labs-and-appointments

For COVID-19 antibody tests, select *routine labwork* in the `service` dropdown. 

I reccommend finding a location that *doesn't* offer employer mandated testing, or drug testing. You can view the services offered at a location on the LabCorp website. 

LabCorp locations within hospitals are frequetly busy. 

## Make an Appointment

After making your choice from the LabCorp location finder, select the `Schedule an Appointment` option. LabCorp is unable to make appointments over the phone. 

For COVID-19 antibody tests, select *routine labwork* in the `service` dropdown. Also, indicate you will not be fasting. 

You may have to enter all your personal information again. The appointment tool 
may not have access to your LabCorp patient account. Once you arrive for your appointment, the office will retreive the order.

Be sure to provide your accurate cell phone number. 

You will receive both an email and text message confirming the appointment. 

Note the address, including any suite number, of the location. 

## Day of Appointment

I reccommend arriving to the location about 15 minutes early. 

Find the text message confirmation you received earlier, and open the link. Complete the online check in process. It may ask if you fasted, say no.

Next, wait for a text message that it's your turn. I'd wait in your car, or outside. Finally, enter the location, and wait the last few minutes. 

It's a simple blood draw, and LabCorp completes them quickly. 

## Results

The results will be delivered to your LabCorp patient account, and by email. 

## Payment

The list price for the test is roughly $50. I wasn't asked to pay anything up front. It looks like the eventual amount due will be $10 after using my Amazon provided health insurance. However, I haven't gotten the exact bill yet.
