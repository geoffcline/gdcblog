Public transit is great for the environment, and it's safer than driving distracted. However, it's very *communal* in Seattle, and is definately a COVID-19 vector.

Let's review the parking (e.g., solo drive) options for employees at the Amazon Seattle Campus, that are appropriate for the medium-term threat COVID sitaution. 

## Parking Models
Amazon has two parking models in Seattle, monthly and occasional. They work more similarly than you think.

1. Occasional Parking
    - you submit receipts for parking expenses, and get reimbursed
    - up to $170 per calendar month
    - the best parking you can find, but unpredictable
2. Monthly Parking
    - you pay a flat monthly fee, which amazon subsidizes 
    - you get a discount based on your actual usage
    - this discount must be calculated manually for some garages
    - for integrated garages, it's based access badge usage 
    - waiting lists! ðŸ˜­

## Occasional Parking
I think occasional parking is the way to go, despite it having more administrative overhead. It's decidely more flexible, and you can take advantage of availability in usually packed garages. 

There are roughly two aspects of this model:
1. Finding a garage
2. Getting reimbursed

Let's talking about finding garages first. 

## Amazon Capacity App

It's a bit hard to find on internal docs, but the ["EP Parking app"](https://amazon-slu.luum.com/commute/content/parking/parking-resources-and-faqs/epfinder-parking-app) on iOS and Android is absolutely essential.

It shows you garages on the Amazon campus and hours of operation. Free hours are also listed, if applicable. The free hours are hand if you are going downtown for pleasure outside of the core working hours. 

It also shows *availbility data* (e.g., the percentage free in a garage), but this isn't very useful in the time of COVID. 

## Amazon Internal Resources

You can view a [list of parking garages](https://amazon-slu.luum.com/commute/content/parking/slu-parking-garages), but it's better to use the app. 

I reccomend saving [this PDF](https://amazon-slu.luum.com/commute/content/parking/seattle-campus-parking-neighborhood-map) of garage locations to your phone.

### Get Creative 

1. Lookup the ["satelite garages"](https://amazon-slu.luum.com/commute/content/parking/satellite-parking) on Inside Amazon. These lots may be cheaper, and have ok locations. For example, consider the Allen Institute garage. 

2. Research public non-office garages. You can get reimbursed regardless of lot. [Pacific Place Mall](https://www.pacificplaceseattle.com/directions-and-parking/) has an "early bird" special if you arrive by 9:30am for $18 -- that's more like semi early bird. You can park nearly 10 days a month on Amazon's dime at that rate. 

3. Use the [Spot Hero](https://spothero.com/parking) app. This is a parking reservation app, where you have to enter your exit/entrance times, and are held to it. For example, you may have to pay a penalty if you stay longer. I've used this to get suprisngly cheap valet parking at hotels when they have extra capacity. 

4. Use the Intix ParkMe App. This app is perhaps a wikipedia of parking, it's crowd sourced data. It's got a lot of info, but the quality varies. The key feature is the map view shows arrows indicating the exact location of garage enterances. That can be essential in packed downtown. 

## Reimbursements for Parking

Please note that the Seattle campus uses the MyCommute website instead of WageWorks. Inexplicably, WageWorks is featured more prominately on Inside Amazon. 

In MyCommute, navigate to the "expenses" link in the left column. Here you can add commute expenses, and you will be reimbursed via your existing direct deposit info. 

Note that you can enter Uber/Lyft expenses, in addition to parking. 

### Receipt Rules

- Less than $25 - No Receipt Required !!! ðŸ¥³
- $25 to $75 - Basic Receipt Required, can be account statement or "card swipe" receipt just showing the total
- $75 and above - Itemized Receipt Required, showing stuff life tax and a description of the charge

My suggestion to help with this paperwork? Get a prepaid debit card (e.g., Amex Bluebird) and keep it in your car. Use it just for parking. Pick a day of the month (e.g., the 10th) and save your transactions from the previous month. Upload them all at once, and refil the prepaid card at the same time. 

## Orca Card
Don't forget you can get an ðŸŽ‰ Unlimited ðŸŽ‰ Orca Card for free. Just [request it](https://amazon-slu.luum.com/accounts/transitcards) on MyCommute. This won't impact your parking benefits. 

## Monthly Parking
During the COVID emergency, new monthly spots aren't being assigned. Also, it's a minimum of $70 for monthly parking. That's after the amazon subsidy and credits for days not used. The [wait lists](https://amazon-slu.luum.com/commute/content/parking/permanent-parking-wait-time) are between 2 and 31 months!

### types of garages
- Integrated Garages
    - You automatically get a credit for days you don't park
- [Non Integreated Garages](https://amazon-slu.luum.com/commute/content/parking/slu-parking-garages/integration-status)
    - Need to manually report your parking status using Commute Calendar

### Commute Calendar

You only need to update this if you (1) have monthly parking, and (2) park in a non-integrated lot. Then, you need to mark this calendar for the days you don't use parking.

## Conclusion

You can park roughy half the time without paying too much, or suffering on a waiting list.
