## Theory

## Indirect Emails
consider situations like:
- emails where you aren't in the "to" line
- for example, emails sent to mailing lists you are a member of 
- emails where there is more than just you on the to line

## External Emails
- luckily at amazon, external messages include the "[EXTERNAL]...." prefix in the subject line, making them a bit easier to handle
- filter external emails UNLESS the person is in your address book
- add known external people to your address book, browse your "external" inbox

## notifications
- desktop
- mobile
- rules that skip inbox don't trigger desktop notifications
- research what happens on mobile

# different post?

## calendar
- move to other calendar
- categories, but don't work on mobile
- mobile works for multiple calendars
