Given that workplace cafeterias have been wrenched from my life, I have had to make some adjustments to my home cooking. 

Frankly, I simply don't have time for some bullshit anymore. 

## i don't miss crisp chicken skin

Many recpies for chicken include the same (extremely fussy) steps. 

Get a mix of breasts and thighs
- I'm not about trying to balance the cooking times of light and dark meat. 
- I'll use exclusively one or the other in a recipe. 

Get meat on the bone -- skin on! -- but make sure to salt under the skin. 
- it's awkward 

Get oil *just under smoking* 
- makes my apartment smell
- sets of smoke alarms
- difficult to get right, can't measure easily

Brown the skin in *batches*
- manage the heat the whole time
- don't burn! but get it crispy!
- develop fond, but don't burn it
- fond is so easy to burn

Now that you have crisp skin, don't let it wet!

ATK often suggests puting sauce on the plate first, to prevent it from getting on the skin. 

Fuck. That. 

No crisp chicken skin is worth forsaking a flavorful sauce. 

Get the sauce all over. Bathe it in sauce. 

The skin is just going to get soggy in the leftovers anyway. The sauce? That will stay just as good. 

Seriously, who thinks chicken skin is worth all this? Just eat a potato chip.

Let's talk about sauce. 

## others 

The tyranny continues with vegetables. What the fuck even is "crisp tender"? 

I'm not having it with the assertion that every ingredient has a 30 second window of optimal donness. 

## more of 
I'm out here boiling potatoes and braising green beans. The window of acceptable done-ness is like ten minutes. It's forgiving. 

- the versatility of a fridge sauce. 
- punchy sauces
- high acceptable zones, eg, braising 
- large quantities
- boneless skinless

## the game plan

### bake a steak

### steam some veg like it's 1999

### potatoes 

### get sauced
- mac cheese
- soy sauce
    - spice it up
- braised green beans
- chimicuri 

- reckless olive oil sauces
