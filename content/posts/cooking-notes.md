Given that workplace cafeterias have been wrenched from my life, I have had to make some adjustments to my home cooking. 

Frankly, I simply don't have time for some bullshit anymore. 

## chicken 

Many recpies for chicken include the same (extremely fussy) steps. 

Get a mix of breasts and thighs
- I'm not about trying to balance the cooking times of light and dark meat.  

Get meat on the bone -- skin on! -- but make sure to salt under the skin. 
- is this even possible? it's like doing surgery on a grape

Get oil *just under smoking* 
- makes my apartment smell
- sets of smoke alarms
- difficult to get right, can't measure easily

Brown the skin in *batches*
- manage the heat the whole time
- don't burn! but get it crispy!
- develop fond, but don't burn it
- fond is so easy to burn

Now that you have crisp skin, don't let it wet!

ATK often suggests puting sauce on the plate first, to prevent it from getting on the skin. 

Fuck. That. 

No crisp chicken skin is worth forsaking a flavorful sauce. 

Get the sauce all over. Bathe it in sauce. 

The skin is just going to get soggy in the leftovers anyway. The sauce? That will stay just as good. 

Seriously, who thinks chicken skin is worth all this? Just eat a potato chip.

### things im not doing 
- browning
- bone-in
- skin on
- mix of light and dark meat
- browning
- fond

### things i am doing
- choosing boneless skinless breasts
- cooking them to the right temperature
- using salt/fat/acid/heat/herbs/citrus to create a flavorful sauce

## others 

The tyranny continues with vegetables. What the fuck even is "crisp tender"? 

I'm not having it with the assertion that every ingredient has a 30 second window of optimal donness. 

## more of 
I'm out here boiling potatoes and braising green beans. The window of acceptable done-ness is like ten minutes. It's forgiving, and that's important. 

I'm also creating flavorful sauces. Tomoato based, olive oil based, chimichurri, tximitxurri (real thing), hummus, french cheese sauce (bechamel), chili crisp, etc. All! So! Good!

It's also a great thing to have a punchy sauce in the fridge, to spice up anything throughout the week. 

## the game plan
Here is a sample of what I made one weekend. 

### bake a steak
I'm not going to get a stakehouse char anyway. I'm going to bake it until it's the right medium-rare internal temperature, and then apply a sauce. 

### steam some veg like it's 1999
I love broccoli with soy sayce. Add some bacon to braised green beans. 

### potatoes 
I enjoy french style potato salads. They have a vinegar base. It's fresh and lovely. Also, much less calories compared to mayo based salads. 

### get sauced
Ok, mac cheese isn't known for being remotely healthy. However, in a reasonable (i.e., small) portion size, it's a luxurious complement to a chicken breast. It's important to use at least some american cheese, to develop a rich sauce.
