It's a common misconception that acne "is just a phase" -- that it resolves natually with age. Acne often hangs around into adulthood and beyond. Additionally, some dermatologists considered clear skin as a mission accomplished -- no more treatment needed. 

A simple skincare routine is essential for people with acne. Even if treatment was a success (as it was for me), it's important to have a maintenance routine. 

That doesn't mean bringing back outdated and unnecessary antiboitics. Let's take a look at some clinically effective and specific ingredients, that you can find in cheap-ish products at target. These aren't pills that impact your entire body, rather you can apply these to places you have acne. 

## Benzoyl Peroxide

This is chemical that kills bacteria, inclding those that want to form acne. The cool thing is that it doesn't contribute to the antibiotic resitance problem. 

I use it in a fase cleanser/wash from CeraVe. It's a great product to apply after you have gotten sweaty and been exposed to the outdoors/pollution/public. It goes a step beyond normal cleansers to really reduce bacteria. 

But it doesn't stop thee. It is also "sebostatic" and "comedolytic" (wikipedia). Essentially, it both reduces product of new pore clogging skin oil, and helps break down old oils. 

This can bleach (e.e., make white stains on) fabrics, such as pillows or shirts. I avoid this by using the face wash in the shower. 

I previously used a cream, but I encountered the staining problem. Also, it was an additional step. 

I, personally, find this ingredient helpful in reducing the number of pimples that I get. However, it seems to work better on smaller ones and outside of the major "problem areas" I have. 

## Synthetic Retinoids 

Personally, my acne seriously improved after I took isotretonin as a pill for a few months.  It's also known as Accutane, and Claravis. 

This perscription drug is seriously good at reducing acne, but it's also expensive and has serious side effects (e.g., peeling skin, join paint). 

You can get the power of this medication without the side effects and much cheaper! Differin is a synthetic retinol, just like Accutane. It's available at Target and fairly cheap at $30ish. 

Even if you took Accutane in the past, it's a good idea to continue using a synthetic retinol like Differin on areas where you had acne. It can prevent acne from coming back. 

Differin works by speeding your skin up. Your skin cells will be replaced with new, healthy ones faster. Differin works great for areas of your skin where you frequently have acne. 

You must apply differin consistently -- every day -- to see results. Differin may help "reset" your skin, but it must be applied every day for this to work. Also, it can take up to six months to see results. Personally, it's worth waiting! 

## Online Dermatologist

Sometimes your skin problems can't be helped with beauty section products, and you need to see a professional. If you have trouble seeing a dermatologist (skin doctor) in your area. I reccommend connecting with one via video chat. Ask your health insurance if they work with a telehealth platform. For example, aetna commonly works with teladoc. Cigna works with MD Live. 

I took pictures of my skin, and uploaded them to the teladoc app. A doctor reviewed them, and perscribed a drug to my local pharamcy. 

I paid about $40, so it's relatively inexpensive. 

## Conclusion

I had *seriously* bad acne. I also am worried about antibiotic overuse. These two ingredients have transformed my skin from always having a breakout, to rarely having one. They are affordable and can be purchased conveniently. They also have few side effects.
