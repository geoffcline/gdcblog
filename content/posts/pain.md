I recently went to the emergency room (nothing serious, luckily). 

## Pain Scales

I was asked numerous times to rate my pain from 1 to 10. Ten was "the worst pain I could imagine"

I find this scale problematic. What is the worst pain I could imagine? Pain is, to a certain extent, a subjective experience. I'm curious if pain could surpass what humans can experience and quantify. 

Does psychological pain count? If you are morning the traumatic loss of your parter, does that make childbirth more painful? I suspect the feeling being torn apart as vagina merges with anus is quite distracting. However, women are definately alert and capable of expressing different emotions during the ordeal. 

At the intersection of various dimensions of pain, annoyance, anguish, and suffering, we find a 10 on the pain scale. It's safe to say that a 10, or the worse pain I could imagine, is signifigant. A sketch of childbirth, dramatic betrayal, bullet ants, the rack, and a fundamental inability to communicate emerges. 

Working from that maximum, provided to me as the anchor for this scale, I encounter additional questions on how the scale is implemented. 

As a practical matter, is it a linear scale? If so, a rating of 6 indicates 50% more pain than a score of 4. However, other natural scales are exponential, such as the richter scale for earthquakes. A rating of 8 could be double the pain of 7. 

I'm going to decide it's a linear scale, because that's probabbly easier to explain to people. 

That leads to an unfortunate problem with the scale. Considering what the sketch of a ten looks like, if I can possibly communicate an answer, how could it be more than 5? Any higher than that and I'd be senselessly wailing. 

I previously had a combination of dry sockets and infected sockets after having my wisdom teeth removed. The pain demanded my constant attention. I'd rate it a 6. 

However, when I was waiting for my brother to prepare the topical pain gel, it was an 8. Relief was so close, but fustratingly slow to arrive. I knew relief was coming, so I was unable to summon the strength to keep the pain managed. 

How does mental processing factor into this rating? Should I rate it as I'm paying full attention to the pain? or when I'm sucessfully occupying my mind? 

To the observing nurse, I took a long time to respond "six."

## The New Web-MD

I contacted telehealth nurse practitioner before going to the emergency room. 

At the onset of the consult, I expected to be given instructions for home care. The nurse seemed genuinely concerned about my condition, and that the sudden onset of pain could indicate a more serious conditoin. She seemed genuine when urging me to visit the emergency room. 

However, at the emergency room, I was told (literally) "oh those [teleheath] nurses, they are just as bad as webmd saying it's cancer, they always tell you to [go] [to the emergency room]."

I wanted to respond with, "have you, as an emergency room physician, considered how selection bias could influence that statement?" -- but I suspected it would be interpreted primarily as sarcasm instead of a theoretical question. Honestly, fair. 

What was the alternative plan? respond to the triage telehealth nurse with "i'll take that under advisement", and rest easy knowing a *Trained Medical Professional* told me to visit the emergency room?

Was the emergency physican suggesting that all the telehealth provider does all day is answer video calls, say "go to the emergency room", and hang up?

Or is the suggestion that I should not try to use urgent care resources before going to the emergency room? 

## Conclusion

I left with instructions to take ibproufen as necessary.
