## Introduction

Amazon's shared deductible plan is good health-care and cost efficient. As of 2020, It's $31/month for an individual, but the effective deductible is only $500/year. 

However, it can be a bit complicated. The good news is that the complexity ultimately benefits the user.

This plan is offered by both Premera and Aetna. It's administered in similar ways by both plans. I have Premera, so I'll use that in the explanation. 

## Preventative Expenses
We are about to get into a complex discussion of deductibles and out of pocket expenses. 

Preventative care ignores all of this. Preventative care is always covered by your insurance. On Amazon's plan, there is *no charge* for preventative care, screenings, and immunizations. In other words, if you are feeling healthy, it's free. 

However, if you get diagnosed with a medical problem (injury, sickness, disease) then you have to worry about the expenses and deductibles as explained below. If you go into the doctor with a problem, that's not preventative care. 

## Components
The underlying plan from Premera has a deductible of $1000. This means that, after you have $1000 in medical expenses, Premera will start helping cover part of the costs. Note that only expenses approved by Premera count towards this total. If you are at a medical facility *in network* with Premera, you don't have to worry about this. They are responsible for making sure everything they do is approved by Premera. 

Note that some medical providers may *accept* Premera, but not be *in network*, sometimes called *contracted*. It's important to ask about this, and be wary of vague answers. 

Just to be clear, before you have $1,000 in health expenses (including prescriptions) you will be billed for the full cost. 

To help with this deductible, Amazon provides a special funding source called a Health Reimbursement Account. Amazon contributes $500 into this account each year, and it's your money. You get to spend it however you like, towards anything under the umbrella of medical expenses. It's important to note that this money rolls over each year, it's not going to vanish. If you don't spend it, you keep it. 

Consider that Premera's $1000 deductible is offset by the $500 from Amazon. In effect, you are only responsible for the "doughnut hole" area, where you have run out of money in the reimbursement account, and you haven't yet met the Premera deductible. Or, dollars $501 to $1000. 

Additionally, after you meet your deductible, Premera doesn't pay all of your medical expenses. They pay (generally) 90%. 

Sadly, It gets more complicated. 

After your $1,000 deductible, Premera pays 90% until you hit your out of pocket maximum. 

The out of pocket maximum is $2,000 for an individual. This is a safeguard, and means that you will be responsible for more than $2,000 for covered medical expenses in a plan year. After your the amount Premera expects you to contribute hits $2,000, they have to pay 100% of your covered medical expenses.

$1,532,000 for an organ transplant at an in-network hospital? Your portion of the bill will be $2,000 -- assuming you haven't paid any other medical bills that year.

Don't forget about the $500 from Amazon! So that $2,000 out of pocket maximum is really $1,500. 

The deductible resets on the first day of your new plan year. At Amazon, the plan year starts on [[find date? march?]]. Also, on the first day of the new plan year you get access to the *full amount* of the health reimbursement account.

### Pro-rating for new employees
It's the nice thing to do.

## Discussion
The plan is only $31/month, but you get $500 tax-free to spend on health-care. 

Have less than <$500 in medical expenses in a year? You keep the money. You could easily build up $2,000 in the account over a few years. If you then had a major medical incident, your account could cover your out of pocket expenses completely. 

American health care is complicated, but Amazon is making a reasonable effort be frugal and meet the needs of their employees. 

## Implementation
This account is a lot to manage. 

You have four "progress bars" to keep track of:
1. Amount remaining in your Amazon Reimbursement Account
2. Amount remaining for your deductible
3. Amount remaining for your out of pocket maximum

You have a few accounts to keep track of
1. Premera Health Insurance Account
2. Amazon Reimbursement Account - accesses via link from Premera
3. Your personal Flex Spending Account (optional)
4. Billing and patient accounts from medical providers
